# Leantime Overview

We believe every team should have access to tools that make work efficient â€” resulting in the best outcomes. Our mission is to commoditize project management.  Open Source Software makes that possible by allowing more managers to access the tools we offer while remaining flexible enough to integrate with existing workflows.

The documentation is split into three major sections as outlined below.

| Developer Docs | Leantime Features | Concepts/Methodolgies |
