### Leantime&reg; ###

Leantime is an open source project management system for non-project manager.<br />We combine strategy, planning and executing while making it easy for everyone on the team to use. Building with ADHD, dyslexia and autism in mind. <br />It's an alternative to ClickUp, Monday, or Asana. As simple as Trello but as feature-rich as Jira.<br />[https://leantime.io](https://leantime.io)<br />
