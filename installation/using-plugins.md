# Using Leantime Plugins

This guide covers how to use Leantime's marketplace plugins after installation. For installation instructions, see [Plugin Installation & Configuration](plugin-installation.md).

## Before You Start

**Plugins must be enabled before use.** After installing a plugin:

1. Go to **Settings → Plugins**
2. Find your plugin in the list
3. Toggle the **Enable** switch to activate it
4. The plugin's features and menu items will now appear

Some plugins add sidebar menu items, others add options within existing features. Each section below describes where to find each plugin's interface.

## Custom Fields

The Custom Fields plugin lets you add custom data fields to tasks, adapting Leantime to your specific workflow needs.

### Accessing Custom Fields

Navigate to **Company Settings → Custom Fields** to manage your custom field definitions.

### Creating a Custom Field

1. Click **Add New Field**
2. Configure the field properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Field Name** | Display name shown on tasks |
| **Field Type** | Text, textarea, dropdown, checkbox, date, number |
| **Required** | Whether the field must be filled in |
| **Conditions** | Limit field to specific projects or task types |

3. Click **Save**

### Field Types

**Text:** Single-line input for short values like reference numbers, codes, or links.

**Textarea:** Multi-line input for longer content like notes or detailed descriptions.

**Dropdown:** Predefined list of options. After selecting this type, add your options:
- Click **Add Option**
- Enter the option value
- Repeat for each choice
- Drag to reorder options

**Checkbox:** Yes/No toggle for binary choices like "Approved" or "Billable."

**Date:** Date picker for tracking deadlines, review dates, or milestones beyond the standard due date.

**Number:** Numeric input for quantities, scores, or measurements.

### Using Conditions

Conditions let you target custom fields to specific contexts rather than applying them globally.

**Project-specific fields:**
1. In the field settings, click **Add Condition**
2. Select **Project** as the condition type
3. Choose which projects should display this field

**Task type-specific fields:**
1. Add a condition for **Task Type**
2. Select which task types (Bug, Feature, Task, etc.) should include this field

You can combine multiple conditions. For example, a "Severity" dropdown that only appears on Bug tasks within your Development project.

### Viewing Custom Field Data

Custom field values appear:
- On the task detail view
- In the task table view (if column is enabled)
- In exports and reports

## Strategy Pro

Strategy Pro connects your daily work to organizational goals through strategic planning tools.

### Creating a Strategy

1. Click the **project dropdown** in the sidebar
2. Select **Start Something New**
3. Choose **Create a Strategy**
4. Fill in the strategy details:
   - **Title:** Name your strategy
   - **Visibility:** Who can view this strategy
   - **Executive Summary:** High-level overview
   - **Company Purpose:** Why your organization exists
   - **Strategic Vision:** Where you want to be in 1-5 years

### Strategy Navigation

Once created, the strategy view includes:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Strategy Overview** | Visual summary of goals and progress |
| **Focus Areas** | Strategic anchors that drive your strategy |
| **Docs** | Strategy-specific documentation |
| **Strategy Boards** | Templates for strategic planning |

### Setting Focus Areas

Focus Areas are the key themes that drive your strategy. Leantime suggests four strategic anchors:

- **Customer:** Goals related to customer satisfaction and experience
- **Financial:** Revenue, cost, and financial health goals
- **Internal Processing:** Operational efficiency and process improvement
- **Learning and Growth:** Team development and organizational capability

To switch between focus areas, click the dropdown arrow next to the focus area name.

### Creating Strategic Goals

1. Navigate to a Focus Area
2. Click **Create Goal**
3. Define the goal:
   - **Title:** Clear, specific goal statement
   - **Metric:** How you'll measure success (percent, currency, number)
   - **Start Value:** Current baseline
   - **End Value:** Target to achieve
   - **Start/End Dates:** Timeframe
   - **Status:** On Track, At Risk, or Miss

### Linking Goals to Milestones

Goals become actionable when linked to project milestones:

1. In the goal details, click **Link Milestone**
2. Select an existing milestone or create a new one
3. As milestone tasks complete, goal progress updates automatically

This dual tracking helps you:
- **Identify warning signs:** Milestone progress on track but metrics not improving? Adjust your approach.
- **Validate strategy:** When milestones correlate with metric improvements, your activities are working.
- **Make decisions:** Data-driven resource allocation based on both execution and impact.

### Linking Projects to Strategy

To connect a project to your strategy:

1. Open the project
2. Click **Project Settings** (bottom left)
3. Under **Part of Program or Strategy**, select your strategy

Or create a new linked project directly from the Strategy Overview by clicking **New Project**.

## Recurring Tasks

The Recurring Tasks plugin automatically creates tasks on a schedule, eliminating repetitive manual task creation.

### Creating a Recurring Task

1. Create a task as normal (this becomes the template)
2. In the task details, click **Make Recurring**
3. Configure the recurrence pattern:

| Pattern | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Daily** | Daily stand-ups, check-ins |
| **Weekly** | Weekly reports, team meetings |
| **Bi-weekly** | Sprint planning, payroll tasks |
| **Monthly** | Monthly reviews, invoicing |
| **Quarterly** | Quarterly planning, OKR reviews |
| **Yearly** | Annual reviews, renewals |

4. Set additional options:
   - **Start Date:** When recurrence begins
   - **End Date:** Optional end to the recurrence
   - **Create X days before due:** Lead time for task creation

5. Click **Save**

### How It Works

- The original task serves as a template
- New task instances are created automatically based on your schedule
- Each instance is independent—completing one doesn't affect others
- Task details (description, assignee, project) copy from the template

### Managing Recurring Tasks

**Identify recurring tasks:** Tasks with active recurrence show a recurrence indicator icon.

**Edit the pattern:** Open the task and click the recurrence settings to modify the schedule.

**Stop recurrence:** Toggle off the recurring setting or set an end date in the task's recurrence options.

**Edit template:** Changes to the original task affect future instances (not already-created ones).

### Common Use Cases

- **Daily stand-ups:** Create at 8 AM each workday
- **Weekly status reports:** Due every Friday
- **Monthly invoicing:** Create on the 25th for month-end processing
- **Quarterly reviews:** Appear 2 weeks before quarter end

## Tips for Plugin Success

### Start Simple

Enable one or two plugins initially. Master them before adding more. Too many features at once can overwhelm rather than help.

### Custom Fields Strategy

- Don't create fields "just in case"—add them when you have a clear use
- Use conditions to keep tasks clean for projects that don't need certain fields
- Review periodically and remove unused fields

### Goal-Setting Best Practices

- Make goals specific and measurable
- Link to milestones for automatic progress tracking
- Use status indicators honestly—"At Risk" early is better than "Miss" late

### Recurring Tasks

- Start with truly repetitive tasks (reports, meetings, reviews)
- Set appropriate lead times so tasks appear with enough notice
- Review recurring patterns quarterly to remove obsolete ones
